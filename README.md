===========

This repository holds my home works for:
Telerik Academy - C# part 2 (January 2013 - Februari 2012)

Course Program

* Arrays
* Multidimensional Arrays
* Methods
* Numeral Systems
* Using Classes and Objects
* Exception Handling

The solutions to the tasks are almost the way they were the day I submitted them, with the exception of some formatting fixes.
